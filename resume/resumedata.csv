Excels at boosting performance and productivity by establishing realistic goals and enforcing deadlines.¬† Versatile IT professional with 37 years of Enterprise design and engineering methodology.

efforts for a major department modernization project involving 3
accreditation packages each leading to successful Authorization To
Operate decisions.  Responsibilities then increased to include all
departmental accreditation efforts leading to another 3 successful
ATOs.  Now, working on 4 new accreditation including
re-authorization for an existing project.  Succeeded in writing and
implementing vulnerability management for existing accredited
systems.





Success
of the accreditation hinged on coordination with ONI Enterprise in
critical design decisions and to help the program integrate smoothly
into the Enterprise thru many meetings, analyzing the Enterprise
business model to understand the best fit for the program.





The
different projects required careful management of specific STIG
compliance and hardening for the different configurations and
services required for the specific domain to be integrated.¬†¬† Analyzed complex computer systems to assess vulnerability and risk.¬†¬†  Supervised  5  external computer consultants and vendors.¬†¬†  Managed application patches, data backup, security changes and network configuration.           Company Name    City  ,   State    Systems Engineer   02/2006   to   02/2011        I was Hired
to initiate processing strategies in fulfilling department analyst requirements.  Requirements were fulfilled thru i dentifying product problems and strengths and collected data on customer experience¬† and review of Enterprise compliance to transition to new
technology for supporting new processing needs thru proper processing
power.¬† The next challenge¬† came as storage requirements for better performance and more
controlled uses.  After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was
adopted to grow local storage to over 200TB.  In using this solution,
the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and
maintenance costs compared to the alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed, purchased and
accredited for operation in the Enterprise.¬† Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from
30 hours to 30 minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru
higher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru
the traditional process.         Company Name    City  ,   State    Senior Systems Analyst   02/1999   to   02/2006        I was hired to improve corporate and
client communications and processing requirements which resulted in
the design, build and deployment of 3 Enterprise network solutions.  One
solution resulted in expanding capabilities to supporting Washington
Navy Yard, Norfolk Virginia and Hawaii support facilities. 






Fulfilled
requirements for detecting crucial network software/hardware
weaknesses and developing preventive strategies and solutions for
avoiding interruptions and increasing system security thru
documenting system layouts, wiring diagrams and addressing schema to
understand layouts and make informed solutions to upper management.
